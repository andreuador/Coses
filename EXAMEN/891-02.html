      The
      <strong>Kentish plover</strong>
      (<i>Charadrius alexandrinus</i>) is a small cosmopolitan
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorebird">shorebird</a>
      (40-44 g) of the family
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charadriidae">Charadriidae</a>
      that breeds on the shores of saline lakes, lagoons, and coasts, populating
      sand dunes, marshes, semi-arid desert, and tundra. Both male and female
      birds have pale plumages with a white underside, grey/brown back, dark
      legs and a dark
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beak">bill</a>, however additionally the male birds also exhibit very dark incomplete
      breast bands, and dark markings either side of their head, therefore the
      Kentish plover is regarded as

      <i>Charadrius alexandrinus</i>
      has a large geographical distribution, ranging from latitudes of 10ยบ to
      55ยบ, occupying North

      , including small populations in Spain and Austria. Some populations are
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bird_migration">migratory</a>
      and often winter in Africa, whereas other populations, such as various
      island populations, do not migrate. Its common English name comes from the

      Kentish plovers are ground-nesting birds, often with a preference for low,
      open, moist nesting sites away from thick vegetation and human activity.
      They use a number of materials to build their nests, mainly consisting of
      shells, pebbles, grass and leaves in a small scrape in the ground. Like
      most plovers, the Kentish plovers are predominantly
